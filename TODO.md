### TODO

#### Global

- [x] Create neighbour lists instead of looping through cells (should create a "multi" style)
- [x] Add a thermostat (a silly one that rescales velocities but keeps u-canonical ensemble)
- [ ] Parallelize
- [ ] Read/write restart files
- [ ] Read dump files
- [ ] Have a more flexible dump format (where we can choose what values we write)

#### CoMD
- [ ] Write mechanism for the CoMD reassignment of momenta
